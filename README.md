This pipeline utilises data from the TCGA-LIHC set from UCSC Xena to examine variations in gene expression across HBV-positive and non-viral cases. Utilising this, it employs classification algorithms to discriminate between the two sample types and identify relevant genes with maximum variation across these types.
The pipeline utilises four different classification algorithms (logistic regression, random forests, SVM (linear, RBF)) and evaluates the performances of each using a stratified 80/20 split of the dataset based on the gene expression data.
